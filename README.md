# Pathfinding Visualizer

This app allows you to visualize Dijkstra's algorithm as it explores nodes in search of the destination node from the start node. You can move the start and destination nodes around and add wall nodes which serve as obstacles that the algorithm will have to get around. Lastly, there is an option to generate random mazes which is done using a randomized version of Prim's algorithm. You can access the application here: https://mariamatthews13.github.io/Pathfinding-Visualizer/
